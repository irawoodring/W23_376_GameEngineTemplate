A simple game engine combining several third party libraries.

- SDL - graphics, input
- FMOD - audio
- Embedded LUA - scripting
- Box2D - physics
- GLM or MathFu - math


## Structure

As always, header files in the `include` directory.  Source files in `src`.  Library files must be compiled for your machine and put in a `lib` folder for linking.

You need to install SDL2 into this project.  I've posted a video on how to do this.
